# Windows Server
+ Windows NT saw several updates over the years, adding in technologies such as [IIS](Internet_Information_Services), various networking protocols, Administrative Wizards to facilitate admin tasks, and more.
## Windows 2000
+ With the release of Windows 2000, Microsoft debuted [Active Directory](Active_Directory), originally intended to help sysadmins set up file sharing, data encryption, VPNs, etc.
+ Windows Server 2000 also included the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) and supported dynamic disk volumes
## Windows 2003
+ Windows Server 2003 came next with server roles, a built-in firewall, the Volume Shadow Copy Service, and more.
## Windows 2008
+ Windows Server 2008 included failover clustering, Hyper-V virtualization software, Server Core, Event Viewer, and major enhancements to [Active Directory](Active_Directory).
## The Present
Over the years, Microsoft released further Server versions, including Server 2012, Server 2016, and most recently, Server 2019. The latest version added support for Kubernetes, Linux containers, and more advanced security features. 

As new versions of Windows are introduced, older versions are deprecated and no longer receive Microsoft updates 1unless a long-term support contract is purchased in some cases). Windows Server 2008 and 2012 reached end of life for security updates on January 14, 2020. Currently, only Server 2012 R2 and later are in support. However, Microsoft has released out-of-band patches for earlier versions of Winbows in the past few years due to the discovery of the critical [[SMBv1 vulnerability]] (Eternal Blue).
# Windows Versions
Many versions of Windows are now deemed "legacy" and are no longer supported. Organizations often find themselves running various older operating systems to support critical applications or due to operational or budgetary concerns. An assessor needs to understand the differences between versions and the various misconfigurations and vulnerabilities inherent to each
