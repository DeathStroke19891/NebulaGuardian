The WMI system along with WMI extensions for [[Windows Driver Model]](WDM) form the foundations for Manageability in Windows 2019/2012/2008 and Windows 10/7/XP. 

WMI is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows-based operating systems. Although you can write WMI scripts or applications to automate administrative tasks on remote computers, WMI also supplies management data to other parts of the operating system and products.
> e.g : System Center Operations Manager or Windows Remote Management

WMI is fully supported by Microsoft. The latest version of administrative scripting and control is available through [[MI]]. [[MI]] is fully compatible with previous versions of WMI, and provides a host of features and benefits that make designing and developing providers and clients easy. 

It is possible to create WMI scripts and applications using C++, C and C#.
