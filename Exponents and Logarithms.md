# Integer Exponents
+ The rules for adding and subtracting exponents during multiplication and division works only when the bases of the expression are the same.
+ 0<sup>0</sup> is undefined, similarly 0 raised to any negative power is undefined
+ Never confuse between 2<sup>3<sup>4</sup></sup> and (2<sup>3</sup>)<sup>4</sup>. Always know what is intended
# Fractional Exponents
+ $\sqrt{}$   symbol is called a radical
+ When working with fractional powers in which numerator is not 1, we use our rule for raising exponential expressions to power backwards.
	$8^{2/3} = 8^{(1/3)(2)} = (8^{1/3})^2 = (2)^2 = 4$      
		 It is my opinion  that this is because to avoid the complexities introduced because of complex numbers and negative roots
	
+ When there is a fractional power in the question, it is assumed to be asking for the positive root, but if we ourselves are introducing a fractional power then, both the positive and negative roots are to be written 
# Simplifying Radical Expressions
+ The number under the radical is called radicand
+ Reduce everything to its simplest form
# Rationalizing Denominators
+ Rationalization of terms like 
	 $$
	 \frac{\sqrt{2}}{5 - \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}}
	$$
	can be done by considering $(5-\sqrt{2})$ as one term and multiplying both numerator and denominator by $(5 - \sqrt{2}) + \sqrt{3}$. And then rationalizing the denominator normally.
# Logarithms
+ The base and the argument of the logarithm must both always be positive if the result of the logarithm is to be a *real number*. 
## Properties of Logarithms
$$
\log_{a}{xy} = \log_{a}{x} + \log_{a}{y}
$$
$$
\log_{a}{(\frac{x}{y})} = \log_{a}{x} - \log_{a}{y}
$$
$$
\log_{a}{x^n} = n\log_{a}{x}
$$
$$
\log_{a}{x} = \frac{\log{a}}{\log{b}} = \frac{\ln{a}}{\ln{b}}
$$
$$
\log_{a}{x} = \log_{a}{y} \implies x = y
$$
